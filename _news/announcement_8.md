Our team's hard work paid off as our paper on Self-supervised SISR for Sentinel-2 (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06871.pdf">L1BSR</a>) was accepted for presentation at EarthVision CVPRW 2023. Code and Dataset are available on <a href="https://centreborelli.github.io/L1BSR/">our project webpage</a>. :smile:
