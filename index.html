<p>Hi there! I’m currently a third-year PhD student at the <a href="https://centreborelli.ens-paris-saclay.fr/en/image-processing" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Centre Borelli</a> in ENS-Paris-Saclay, where I specialize in image and video restoration using deep learning. My research primarily focuses on remote sensing, and I’m fortunate to be working under the guidance of <a href="http://dev.ipol.im/~facciolo/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Gabriele Facciolo</a> and <a href="http://dev.ipol.im/~pariasm/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Pablo Arias</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to my PhD studies, I completed a master’s degree in Mathematics, Vision and Learning (MVA) at <a href="https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">École Normale Supérieur Paris-Saclay</a>. I also earned a bachelor’s degree from <a href="https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Sorbonne University (ex UPMC)</a>, where I majored in applied mathematics.</p>

<p>I’m passionate about applying cutting-edge technologies to solve complex problems, and I’m excited to continue pursuing my research in image processing. In my free time, I enjoy playing chess, hiking, and exploring new cities.</p>
