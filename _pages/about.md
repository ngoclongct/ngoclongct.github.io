Hi, I'm currently a 3rd year PhD student in Image Processing group at <a href="https://centreborelli.ens-paris-saclay.fr/en/image-processing">Centre Borelli</a>, ENS-Paris-Saclay.

My work focuses in image and video restoration using deep learning, particularly in the context of remote sensing, working under the supervision of <a href="http://dev.ipol.im/~facciolo/">Prof. Gabriele Facciolo</a> and <a href="http://dev.ipol.im/~pariasm/">Dr. Pablo Arias</a>.

Before that, I graduated from <a href="https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/">École Normale Supérieur Paris-Saclay</a> through the master's degree program MVA (mathematics, vision and learning) and I received a bachelor degree from <a href="https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en">Sorbonne University (ex UPMC)</a> with majors in applied mathematics.
