Hi there! I recently completed my PhD in image and video restoration for satellite imagery at the <a href="https://centreborelli.ens-paris-saclay.fr/en/image-processing">Centre Borelli</a> in ENS-Paris-Saclay under the guidance of <a href="http://dev.ipol.im/~facciolo/">Prof. Gabriele Facciolo</a> and <a href="http://dev.ipol.im/~pariasm/">Dr. Pablo Arias</a>. My thesis, defended on 20 October 2023, received commendation from a distinguished committee including Prof. Andr√©s Almansa, Prof. Enrico Magli, Prof. Jean Ponce, Prof. Florence Tupin, Asst. Prof. Charlotte Pelletier, and Dr. Thibaud Ehret.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a master's degree in Mathematics, Vision and Learning (<a href="https://www.master-mva.com/">MVA</a>) from ENS Paris-Saclay and a bachelor's degree in applied mathematics from Sorbonne University (ex UPMC). My journey, rooted in dedicated study and a passion for discovery, has led me to become a research scientist at Enhance Lab, where I continue to explore and develop innovative solutions in image processing and computer vision.

Beyond the lab, I'm passionate about chess, hiking, and exploring new cities, always on the lookout for new challenges and adventures.
